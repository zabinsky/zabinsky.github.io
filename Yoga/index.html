	<h1>My Yoga Journey</h1>
	<p>I was first
  introduced to Iyengar yoga in college and wrote my first yoga essay on why tree pose was my favorite pose to help me recognize and balance the stress of taking organic chemistry and chinese language classes. 
  In grad school, I was inspired by power yoga and explored many different styles of asana. When I realized my rotator cuff was torn (upon moving to the Bay Area),
  I decided I needed to learn more to continue to practice safely. That led me to yoga teacher training with Mark Stephens in Santa Cruz, CA. Now all I want to do is share everything I've learned!</p>
